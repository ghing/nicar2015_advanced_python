Advanced Python
===============

Excercises and sample code for the [advanced Python workshop](http://ire.org/events-and-training/event/1494/1805/) at [NICAR 2015](http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/).

Picking up where the intermediate session leaves off, this workshop will introduce some interesting, exciting and useful language features of Python in the context of building news applications and tools.  Topics include advanced object oriented design (inheritance vs. composition, multiple inheritance, mixins), functional programming (iterators, generators, decorators, map/reduce, lambda functions) and test-driven development.  
To get the most out of this class, you should have written at least one complex Python application and wondered if there was a better way.

Test-driven development
more advanced OO (composition, multiple inheritance, super method, method resolution order, dynamic delegation/dispatch)
more advanced functional programming tricks and tools (lambda, map, filter, generators and yield)
properties and decorators
magic methods such as __call__
